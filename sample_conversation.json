        "role": "agent",
        "text": "I see. Let's troubleshoot that. First, let's make sure the thermostat is in pairing mode. On the thermostat, press and hold the power button for 5 seconds until you see the Wi-Fi icon blinking. Do you see that blinking icon?"
    },

        "role": "customer",

    {
        "role": "agent",
        "text": "Great! Now, go back to the app, tap 'Add Device' and then select 'Thermostat' from the list of devices. Then tap 'Next' and the app should start scanning for your device."
    },
    {
        "role": "customer",
        "text": "Okay, I'm doing that now... Hey, it found the device! It's asking me to select my Wi-Fi network."
    },
    {
        "role": "agent",
        "text": "Excellent! Select your Wi-Fi network and enter your Wi-Fi password when prompted. The thermostat should connect within a minute or two."
